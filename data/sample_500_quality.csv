clear-protocol,"Clear Protocol is an AI, Software-as-a-Service for hospitals, clinics, and medical offices. Contemporaneous validation of clinical practice is recognized as critically important. However, often this is not carried out because most clinical interventions happen alongside a patient, and devices such as desktop computers, iPads or smartphones are impractical due to potential hand contamination, the inconvenience of being out of reach, out of view, interruption, and distractions.  The solution we developed, Clear Protocol, can be the new, practical, unobtrusive system that finally enables validation to be done contemporaneously, every time - all the time, at the point of care.  The purpose of Clear Protocol® is to enhance the way validation of clinical practice is carried out – as being an important step towards safe practice. The objective is to give clinicians an effective tool to validate clinical guidelines, not to change the way they practice.","There are 440,000 deaths a year from preventable medical errors in hospitals. Our technology can potentially eliminate them, save doctors hours a day and reduce hospitals’ costs.

We are based in Los Angeles and we have internationally renowned advisors with PhDs in Health Informatics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Psychology (marketing), MBAs, and more. Our approach is gaining converts among doctors and nurses.

Clear Protocol (TM) is similarly useful in many other major industries. Such as food processing.

News for January 2018: Clear Protocol, Inc. is proud to announce that in collaboration with staff at a renowned local hospital and faculty from two major universities, we have been awarded a development grant. This grant will be used towards our initial pilot study. Which begins at the hospital in the first quarter, 2018. 

Our goal: To improve patient safety. 

Our Mission: To promote verification and logging as part of the standard of care in medicine.

 There are 440,000 deaths a year from preventable medical errors in hospitals. Our technology can potentially eliminate them, save doctors hours a day and reduce hospitals’ costs.

We are based in Los Angeles and we have internationally renowned advisors with PhDs in Health Informatics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Psychology (marketing), MBAs, and more. Our approach is gaining converts among doctors and nurses.

Clear Protocol (TM) is similarly useful in many other major industries. Such as food processing.

News for January 2018: Clear Protocol, Inc. is proud to announce that in collaboration with staff at a renowned local hospital and faculty from two major universities, we have been awarded a development grant. This grant will be used towards our initial pilot study. Which begins at the hospital in the first quarter, 2018. 

Our goal: To improve patient safety. 

Our Mission: To promote verification and logging as part of the standard of care in medicine.

 Clear Protocol is an AI, Software-as-a-Service for hospitals, clinics, and medical offices. Contemporaneous validation of clinical practice is recognized as critically important. However, often this is not carried out because most clinical interventions happen alongside a patient, and devices such as desktop computers, iPads or smartphones are impractical due to potential hand contamination, the inconvenience of being out of reach, out of view, interruption, and distractions.  The solution we developed, Clear Protocol, can be the new, practical, unobtrusive system that finally enables validation to be done contemporaneously, every time - all the time, at the point of care.  The purpose of Clear Protocol® is to enhance the way validation of clinical practice is carried out – as being an important step towards safe practice. The objective is to give clinicians an effective tool to validate clinical guidelines, not to change the way they practice.

factivate,"Factivate provides a business intelligence and just-in-time decision engine that is capable automating data aggregation processes and understanding how decisions (or reactions) are made based off of a business' KPIs. From that metadata, we can derive what information is important per individual, company, or industry, and provide automated recommendations (or reactions) to help the individual maximize their capital. Best of all, the solution requires no learning curve or programming to use.

Our unique IP provides detection ranges of 25-100m and utilizes electronic beam steering to enhance resolution and accuracy.  With this capability, OmniPreSense brings autonomous operation to non-automotive systems including drones, robots, and other IoT solutions.

 OmniPreSense is developing Smart City traffic monitoring sensors to help make our cities safer. The sensors detect excessive speeding and are networked to provide real time alerts or traffic reports. This data is easily provided to authorities for speed calming or other corrective actions. We are currently in Beta site testing of our product. We have validation of the market as we have had customers who are engineers buying our base radar sensor and building their own traffic monitor. Now we're building a simple to use solution for everyone. Our product is like Ring, but instead of protecting your door we protect your neighborhood. OmniPreSense was founded on 2016 and is headquartered in San Jose, California.

take-command-health,Take Command Health is an innovative health insurance software provider for small businesses and independent professionals. Take Command Health enables small employers to reimburse employees tax-free for health insurance using a small business HRA (QSEHRA).  The company empowers employees and independent professionals to make smart health insurance decisions using our innovative plan choice software and health management tools.,"Take Command Health was born about the same time their founder Jack and his wife Brittany were surprised with a twin pregnancy–a huge blessing but an equally bigger surprise.

 The environmental services industry is ripe for a revolutionary change. Scientists and consultants are bogged down with tedious busywork, stuck in an office compiling paperwork and tabulating data. Most consultants would rather be out in the field conducting stream/wetland assessments, collecting data and delineating patterns in nature.

Our suite of digital tools and industry expertise transforms the pen and paper driven environmental services industry into a smartphone and cloud driven model of efficiency — reducing time-on-task of data management and reporting by 40%. This is not a one size fits all smartphone app that simply creates a PDF. Created from inside the environmental consulting industry, ecobot is tailored specifically to scientists conducting regulatory assessments in respect to each and every part of the application and workflow.

Only ecobot provides a way to rapidly input streams and wetlands field data and transforms that data into a fully customizable report.

cloudmedx,"At CloudMedx, we collect and convert disparate healthcare data into a holistic, actionable view of the individual. Our aligned approached is based on integrating with existing systems, becoming an intuitive extension of the way providers, payers, and even patients collaborate. CloudMedx’s mission was born out of the near-death experience of the founder’s father as a result of a misdiagnosis.

 At CloudMedx, we collect and convert disparate healthcare data into a holistic, actionable view of the individual. Our aligned approached is based on integrating with existing systems, becoming an intuitive extension of the way providers, payers, and even patients collaborate. CloudMedx’s mission was born out of the near-death experience of the founder’s father as a result of a misdiagnosis. This was ultimately a symptom of an overrun system that does not function as well as it could. In order to deliver better, more accurate care, we decided to take an aligned approach; to unite healthcare across the continuum and benefit both patients, payers, and doctors. By using data as our superpower instead of an obstacle, together we can fundamentally change the future of healthcare.

Its benefits automation software allows businesses to manage their benefits in minutes per month. PeopleKeep automates benefits compliance and employee support.

Offering traditional group benefits sucks. Why? They’re too expensive, too complex, and too one-size-fits-all. PeopleKeep is a new way to offer benefits called personalized benefits. Most people believe benefits are the services a company offers, such as a health insurance plan or 401(k). With personalized benefits, it’s the opposite. Companies give people tax-free money to spend on the consumer services they find most valuable. It’s as simple as wages.

Offering traditional group benefits sucks. Why? They’re too expensive, too complex, and too one-size-fits-all. PeopleKeep is a new way to offer benefits called personalized benefits. Most people believe benefits are the services a company offers, such as a health insurance plan or 401(k). With personalized benefits, it’s the opposite. Companies give people tax-free money to spend on the consumer services they find most valuable. It’s as simple as wages. For small businesses that think offering traditional group benefits sucks, PeopleKeep is personalized benefits automation software that makes offering benefits simple, painless, and personal for everyone. Today more than 3,000 companies use PeopleKeep to hire and keep their people across the United States. PeopleKeep is based in Salt Lake City, Utah.

data-gumbo-corporation,"Data Gumbo’s mission is to empower enterprises and their business networks to transact securely, efficiently, and transparently. Data Gumbo provides the industry’s only smart contract platform enabling organizations, their customers, suppliers, and vendors to successfully incorporate real-time sensor level and field data to validate and automate transactions—eliminating payment delays, disputes, and complicated reconciliations. Subscribers are able to increase operational efficiencies, accountability, transparency, contract, and cash flow certainty. Data Gumbo’s smart contract platform provides a unique combination of state-of-the-art distributed ledger technology, real-time IoT sensor data, and applications with APIs to eliminate the need for countless audits. This reduces friction to deliver streamlined operations and transactional certainty while maintaining security controls to protect our customers and their network. Created specifically for enterprises, Data Gumbo’s smart contract platform reinvents the way companies transact. Data Gumbo is a venture-backed organization that serves clients globally, across multiple industries. Learn more at www.datagumbo.com.","For companies that drill for oil and gas, Data Gumbo provides blockchain smart contracts.  Customers can use these smart contracts to secure the 10's - 100's of millions in savings available from improvements in rig and supplier efficiency.

A blockchain is a network of interconnected computers that provide an encrypted distributed ledger of transactions.  One aspect of blockchain solutions is smart contracts.  Smart contracts execute terms of a contract automatically.  Automating execution of a contract removes all the “friction” from your business.  

Examples:
Regular Contracts:  Encode the terms of an existing contract into a smart contract.  Execute the smart contract automatically, when contract terms are met.  This radically reduces the amount of reviews each invoice and payment requires.

Incentive Contracts:  Encode the terms of an incentive contract into a smart contract, locking in the bonus and penalty terms based on actual performance.  The contract guarantees the service provider is paid for improvements and the buyer only pays for services received and gains realized.   

Resource sharing Contracts:   Companies frequently utilize expensive resources such as ships and helicopters to deliver supplies to remote locations.  Each company bears the expense of a separate fleet rather than pooling resources with competitors operating nearby.  Previously, the complications of accurately measuring, allocating and billing the expenses prevented economical resource sharing.  Not anymore.  Smart contracts guarantee accurate execution of the terms of a sharing agreement.  

In short, automating execution of contracts eliminates accounting expenses, time delays, inaccuracies, legal fees, mistrust and disputes.  At the same time, it increases audibility and profitability.  It aligns incentives of all participants towards a common goal.

Best of all, smart contracts do not require you to change any of your existing systems.

 Lumidize® was recently introduced into an $11B metal pretreatment market that has seen no major innovation in decades.  The aluminum oxide coating, which will be the first of many products based on LumiShield’s revolutionary proprietary chemistry, improves adhesion of paints to metals and helps them resist corrosion more effectively.  Lumidize is attractive to manufacturers of metal products because it can be applied to a wide range of metal substrates and multi-metal components and improves paint performance.

We were the first mobile sports app to ever host a professional level ''tryout'' directly on our app. Check out both apps in the Apple App Store and Android's Google Play Store.,"GoldCleats is an online communication, development, and recruitment platform that connects players all over the world to one another through their personalized accounts. GoldCleats provides players with the opportunity to showcase their talent to teams, scouts, agents, and coaches. On GoldCleats, you can connect and communicate with your teammates, friends, and coaches through the inbox messenger feature. You can also find an agent to represent you or simply showcase your talent to a scout or team looking for new talent. Recruiters such as scouts, agents, coaches and teams will join GoldCleats by end of summer 2014.

GoldCleats is currently open for players and GoldCleats Coaches only. This gives each player a chance to work on their profile before recruiters join.
After signing up and logging into your account, a player must click on the profile tab to input and store their personal and technical information. Players can upload and store as many videos as they want. Players are encouraged to showcase their skills through their videos and earn GoldCleats skill cards.

Players can also customize their news in their News section. This allows a user to decide where they want to receive news from and what kind of content they would like to read. This helps our users stay updated with the world and be the first to get the news and inside scope on their favorite players, coaches and teams.

GoldCleats also offers two types of evaluation tests. The Skill Evaluation Test is designed to test a players individual skill. A Match Evaluation Test evaluates a players performance in a game. Both tests require players to upload their own footage with no editing. Once the video is uploaded, a player may choose one of our GoldCleats Coaches to evaluate them. Our coaches will fill out an evaluation form with a final grade. Players may then choose to post their evaluation and their final score on their account dashboard for others to view.

GoldCleats does not guarantee that any player or all players will get recruited, however it allows players to measure their chances of getting viewed by a team, coach, agent or scout by frequently checking their Experience Bar (EXP).

Teams, scouts, agents, and coaches will always prefer to look at an account with an EXP indicator that is 50% or over.

nebulous-llc,"Skynet Labs builds uncompromising software infrastructure for the decentralized internet. It is a leader in the burgeoning blockchain and decentralized web ecosystems, and the core contributor and maintainer of the open-source Skynet project. Skynet is a revolutionary technology that will be the foundation for a free internet and builds on the team’s successful creation of Sia, the leading blockchain storage platform.","Sia is a collaborative data storage platform which allows users to store and retrieve large amounts of data quickly and securely. Smart contracts allow users to seamlessly acquire storage from hosts all over the world which have agreed to rent space on their hard drives. Sia’s blockchain-based technology ensure hosts aren’t able to see inside the data they store while guaranteeing the data is available when needed. By creating a marketplace where thousands of hosts bid on a storage contract, this allows the platform to be more reliable and also deliver significant cost savings compared to traditional cloud providers.

Sia is reinventing cloud storage. Their technology connects users who need file storage with hosts worldwide offering underutilized hard drive capacity. Their blockchain technology secures their data and enables breakthrough economics for users and hosts.

The Sia blockchain allows us to run this marketplace without an intermediary. They secure storage transactions with smart contracts, creating a more reliable and affordable offering when compared to traditional cloud providers. No one person or organization can censor or deny access to data — not miners, not developers, nor any government. Sia’s distributed, decentralized storage technology is stronger, more secure, more efficient, and more equitable for the entire ecosystem.

2018_description:
 Sia is a collaborative data storage platform which allows users to store and retrieve large amounts of data quickly and securely. Smart contracts allow users to seamlessly acquire storage from hosts all over the world which have agreed to rent space on their hard drives. Sia’s blockchain-based technology ensure hosts aren’t able to see inside the data they store while guaranteeing the data is available when needed. By creating a marketplace where thousands of hosts bid on a storage contract, this allows the platform to be more reliable and also deliver significant cost savings compared to traditional cloud providers.

Sia is reinventing cloud storage. Their technology connects users who need file storage with hosts worldwide offering underutilized hard drive capacity. Their blockchain technology secures their data and enables breakthrough economics for users and hosts.

The Sia blockchain allows us to run this marketplace without an intermediary. They secure storage transactions with smart contracts, creating a more reliable and affordable offering when compared to traditional cloud providers. No one person or organization can censor or deny access to data — not miners, not developers, nor any government. Sia’s distributed, decentralized storage technology is stronger, more secure, more efficient, and more equitable for the entire ecosystem.

Sia believes that neither individuals nor institutions should be beholden to large corporations. Sia was created to promote and safeguard users’ freedoms. It’s their attempt to bring decentralized storage built on blockchain technology to the mainstream without sacrificing price or performance.

A revolution in virtual reality is underway—consumers can now explore virtual worlds with the natural use of their hands and eyes thanks to affordable devices such as the Razer Hydra and Oculus Rift. The Omni evolves virtual reality one step further, allowing anyone to stand up and traverse virtual worlds with the natural use of their own feet. Moving naturally in virtual reality creates an unprecedented sense of immersion.

True virtual reality cannot be experienced sitting down. The panoramic visuals offered by head mounted displays need corresponding natural movement to maintain our sense of orientation and feeling of immersion.

The Omni will free gamers from passive, seated gameplay, unleashing the full potential of virtual reality gaming with the Oculus Rift and future head mounted displays. Gaming on a keyboard, mouse or gamepad while seated pales in comparison to the intense experience and fun that comes from actually walking, running, and jumping in games.

Users walk naturally—and the result is a natural interface that works with any game or application that uses keyboard input. Walk, run, jump, or strafe—movements mapped to the keyboard can be mapped to natural motion with the Omni.

Applications of natural movement in virtual reality stretch far beyond gaming: training and simulation, fitness, virtual tourism, virtual tradeshows and events, meet-ups and multi-person adventures, virtual workplaces, museums, VR architecture, VR concerts… The possibilities are limitless.

Exonate’s lead programme is focused on Diabetic Macular Oedema (DMO). A consequence of diabetic retinopathy, DMO, is swelling in an area of the retina called the macula and wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration (wAMD), which is the leading cause of vision loss in people aged 60 and older.  The Company is founded on scientific excellence with strong links to Professor David Bates and his lab at Nottingham University specializing in the biology and biochemical pathways of VEGF splice variants. Exonate have developed small molecules that inhibit production of pro-angiogenic VEGF through selective inhibition of serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (SRPK1)-mediated VEGF splicing.  These inhibitors have already demonstrated superior efficacy as topical agents in preclinical models of wet AMD.  Through a Wellcome Trust funded project, Exonate has completed an optimization programme and has nominated a pre-clinical candidate drug with optimal characteristics. During the second quarter of 2020 regulatory toxicology and safety pharmacology studies have taken place. This is to support the successful application to the regulatory authorities for clinical evaluation.   Exonate is led by an experienced, international management team that has previously worked together with cross-disciplinary experience in medicine and drug development, as well as successful fundraising for early stage companies. About Diabetic Macular Oedema (DMO)*: DMO is the build-up of fluid (Oedema) in a region of the retina called the macula. The macula is important for the sharp, straight-ahead vision that is used for reading, recognizing faces, and driving. DMO is the most common cause of vision loss among people with diabetic retinopathy. About half of all people with diabetic retinopathy will develop DMO and although it is more likely to occur as diabetic retinopathy worsens, DMO can happen at any stage of the disease. About wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration (wet AMD): Today, wet AMD is a leading cause of vision loss in people aged 60 years or older and affects more than 30 million patients worldwide, over 200,000 of those in the UK alone. If untreated patients are likely to lose sight in the affected eye within 24 months of disease onset. The main currently available treatment options for DMO and wet AMD are: •	anti-VEGF antibody drugs – to prevent the growth of new blood vessels in the eye. Unlike small molecule drugs or eye drops these treatments must be injected into the eye once every 1 or 2 months. Resistance can develop to these drugs causing the disease to progress anew. •	Laser surgery – to destroy abnormal blood vessels in the eye. This type of surgery is only suitable if blood vessel damage is not too extensive and if the abnormal blood vessels aren't close to the fovea, as performing surgery close to this part of the eye can cause permanent vision loss. •	With DMO, Corticosteroids either injected or implanted into the eye, may be used alone or in combination with other drugs or laser surgery to treat DMO. *source: https://nei.nih.gov/health/diabetic/retinopathy","Exonate Limited was founded in 2013 and is based in Nottingham and Cambridge in the UK. Exonate is a biopharmaceutical company focussed on the discovery and development of small molecule drugs that modulate alternative mRNA splicing to address diseases of high unmet medical need.

 The wearable device comes in two parts, a wristband and a back device, which can integrate into the back brace of a worker. The device has sensors, which coupled with our machine learning algorithms, can analyze the biomechanics of a worker during a lift and calculate their risk of injury. If the lift has a high risk of injury, workers get feedback on the wristband through a display, a red LED and a optionally, a light vibration.
Managers can also access analytics about the risk profile of individual workers enabling them to develop specific training programs, just as you would with a regular athlete. They also receive analytics about the entire workforce, and actionable insights on how to reduce that risk.

tubescience,"As one of the fastest growing startups in Los Angeles, we're revolutionizing the way in which companies approach successful video advertising. Our team of award-winning Producers, Editors, Directors, Engineers, and Performance Marketing Managers are building a global studio where we can conceptualize, shoot, and produce hundreds of videos per day. Unlike traditional advertising agencies that pitch creative concepts for companies, hope they will perform, and outsource filming, we design videos that are guaranteed to convert. We use data to guide our creative process and leverage testing and analysis to make adjustments to react to users in real-time. What's atypical about the company: 1. We're fast and data-driven: our teams develop concepts in the morning, shoot/edit in the afternoon, launch in the evening, and iterate the next day based on real-world performance. 2.

 As one of the fastest growing startups in Los Angeles, we're revolutionizing the way in which companies approach successful video advertising. Our team of award-winning Producers, Editors, Directors, Engineers, and Performance Marketing Managers are building a global studio where we can conceptualize, shoot, and produce hundreds of videos per day. Unlike traditional advertising agencies that pitch creative concepts for companies, hope they will perform, and outsource filming, we design videos that are guaranteed to convert. We use data to guide our creative process and leverage testing and analysis to make adjustments to react to users in real-time. What's atypical about the company: 1. We're fast and data-driven: our teams develop concepts in the morning, shoot/edit in the afternoon, launch in the evening, and iterate the next day based on real-world performance. 2. We’re a behavioral R&D lab at the core: We put 2,000+ video experiments per week, watched by tens of millions of people per day, that give us deep insights into how people make decisions. Over the past couple of years, we’ve built an enormous library of IP around human behavior and visual communication. 3. We work on a pure pay for performance basis. Zero production fees for video.

 We are doing in e-commerce what Uber did in the taxi industry and AirBnB did in the hotel industry.

OmniBazaar is a community-owned, rewards-driven, cryptocurrency-enabled, peer-to-peer, e-commerce marketplace. The OmniBazaar system includes its own built-in cryptocurrency (OmniCoin), an influencer marketing system, social messaging, reputation tracking, escrow agents, and bonuses to provide user incentives for participation and growth. With OmniBazaar, online sellers save 90% of the fees they currently pay Amazon or eBay. Online buyers benefit from lower prices, and escape from ""big data"" tracking and ""push"" marketing. Social influencers enjoy a simple way to monetize their social networks. Marketplace buyers and sellers can generate additional income by providing services in the marketplace.

 We’re a next generation private investment firm with a unique model for our investors to access the private markets. In addition to making principal investments in venture to growth stage companies, we offer our family office, institutional, and strategic investors access to vetted direct and co-investment opportunities primarily in FinTech / InsurTech / PropTech. Our mandate includes any technology or service that could be synergistic to a bank, insurance or financial service company. RueOne supplements the traditional fund structure by allowing our investors to participate in individual venture capital and private equity transactions with the benefit of our sourcing, structuring, due diligence, domain expertise, and professional management. We operate exclusively as an investment advisor, not a broker dealer, and we are compensated exclusively by our investors. Our participation in a potential investment opportunity comes in the form of a principal investment by RueOne as a general partner and/or direct & co-investments from our family office and institutional clients.  STAGE We make investments ranging from early stage venture capital to growth stage private equity. We do not look to take technology or product risk around proof of concept. However, we are well-positioned to help management teams with go-to-market strategies, scaling their business, and executing their vision. We like to invest in companies where our capital can be used to fuel revenue growth, drive efficiencies, and/or make strategic acquisitions. FINANCIALS While we are flexible around our revenue and EBITDA requirements, we generally do not make investments in pre-revenue companies. SECTORS We are opportunistic and have historically invested across sectors. Our current area of focus is FinTech/InsurTech and includes any technology or service that could be synergistic with a bank, insurance or financial services company. . We pursue a multi-sector, bottoms-up approach with the benefit of highly specialized sector-specific investment and operational expertise.

 Rowing Blazers is a New York-based brand known for its colorful, sporty, slightly subversive take on the classics, as well as its cult following and limited-edition collaborations.  Founded by American designer Jack Carlson in 2017, the brand combines elements from the worlds of tailoring, sportswear, and streetwear — helping to redefine “preppy” and bringing the classics to new audiences and a new generation. Rowing Blazers began as a tailoring house dedicated to crafting club blazers (the world’s first sporting uniforms).  Today the brand continues this tradition, but also draws inspiration from the the “preppy” canon and the world of sport more broadly.  Beyond tailoring, Rowing Blazers is also known for its rugby and polo shirts, outerwear, knits, leisurewear, accessories, and fast-selling collaborations with the likes of Umbro, FILA, Seiko, Noah, Eric Emanuel, Barbour, and more. Named one of the top ten fastest-growing DTC brands in the world in 2021, Rowing Blazers has developed a cult following that includes Timothée Chalamet, Gwyneth Paltrow, Dwyane Wade, Emily Ratajkowski, Justin and Hailey Bieber, Mindy Kaling, Chloë Sevigny, Russell Westbrook, BTS, Tan France, B.J. Novak, Carmelo Anthony, Ashley Graham, Lukas Gage, Maude Apatow, Randall Park, Wayne Diamond, Millie Bobby Brown, Ziwe Fumudoh, Jordan Clarkson, Will Ferrell, Tom Daly, Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo, Joe Keery, Charles Melton, Christian Pulisic, Donovan Mitchell, Whitney Peak, Tom Daley, Madelaine Petsch, Ronny Chieng, Romeo Beckham, Tracy Morgan, Dax Shepard, Mario Carbone, Thundercat, A$AP Nast, Macklemore, and Pete Davidson. Rowing Blazers works with some of the best fabric mills, artisans, and workshops in the world, all of whom share the brand’s own dedication to quality, traditional craftsmanship, and ethical sourcing.

weeact,"WeeAct is the free, decision-making iOS app where users make smarter decisions by crowd-voting choices with others and then sharing the outcomes. How It Works: CREATE – Post an everyday decision and two choices. VOTE - Other users vote on which choice you should pick. DECIDE - Review the votes, make your decision, and share the outcome of your decision with everyone who voted. Launch a WeeAct campaign around any decision using text and pictures. Here are some example decisions that WeeAct can help you make: - Fashion: What outfit should I wear? - Lifestyle: Which haircut should I get? - Consumer: What brand should I buy? - Blogging: Which tutorial should I post next on my blog? - Events: Which party should I go to tonight? - Design: What color should I paint my room? - Investing: Which stock should I buy? - Romance: Who should I go out on a date with? - Education: Which class should I enroll in? - Fitness: What should I do for my workout? - Health: What food should I eat on my diet? - Social: Which picture should I use in my profile? WeeAct Benefits: ● Create a decision campaign and harness the wisdom of the crowd in just seconds. ● Don't passively browse content. Participate in the decision-making of other users by voting on their choices and inspiring them to act. ● Stop scrolling through feeds of content that you don't care about. Automatically personalize your feed on WeeAct because every time you vote on a decision, you'll receive relevant content that shows the outcome. ● Stop wasting time looking at ads. WeeAct does not support or show ads anywhere on the app and all of our content is crowd-sourced by regular, everyday people, just like you! ● Think you give good advice? See for yourself using WeeAct's Voting Accuracy which tracks how often what you picked is the choice that gets made. ● Get feedback without the noise. Harassment is a major issue on some apps, but on WeeAct users cannot message each other and no one can post comments on campaigns. ● Create content your audience wants. Make your audience feel like they are part of the creative decision-making process by crowd-voting your content on WeeAct. ● Use our 5-star rating system to rate each other's decisions based on the success or failure of the outcome. ● Increase your vote totals by sharing your WeeAct campaigns on different social networks. ● WeeAct is committed to protecting all user data on our application. We do not sell or share any user data with third parties. The Human Intelligence App: WeeAct has been designed to take advantage of human intelligence by eliminating biases that exist within the crowd. Each voter is ambiguous to the decision-maker, which allows people to vote, honestly, based on their own experiences with that decision. The crowd becomes smarter as more votes are cast on any single decision by eliminating these biases. If life is just a series of decisions, WeeAct is too valuable of a utility not to use. If you struggle to make decisions, WeeAct will revolutionize your life. Download our app for free today and start making smarter decisions . . . together. Got feedback? Send us a message at info@weeact.com. Check out our social media on Twitter and Instagram @WeeActApp","WeeAct is a new decision-making social network that helps users make smarter decisions by harnessing the power of crowd-voting and decision-sharing. Users create campaigns by presenting two options for decisions they face. Other users vote on those campaigns, giving their opinion on which choice is best.

When ready to make a decision based on the crowd-voting, the campaign creator sends out video or photo content to everyone who voted to show them the outcome. Create powerful decision networks where you're influencing others to follow through on their decisions. Life is a series of decisions and WeeAct is the coolest place to crowd-vote digital storytelling content.

2018_description:
 WeeAct is a new decision-making social network that helps users make smarter decisions by harnessing the power of crowd-voting and decision-sharing. Users create campaigns by presenting two options for decisions they face. Other users vote on those campaigns, giving their opinion on which choice is best.

When ready to make a decision based on the crowd-voting, the campaign creator sends out video or photo content to everyone who voted to show them the outcome. Create powerful decision networks where you're influencing others to follow through on their decisions. Life is a series of decisions and WeeAct is the coolest place to crowd-vote digital storytelling content.

 WeeAct is the free, decision-making iOS app where users make smarter decisions by crowd-voting choices with others and then sharing the outcomes. How It Works: CREATE – Post an everyday decision and two choices. VOTE - Other users vote on which choice you should pick. DECIDE - Review the votes, make your decision, and share the outcome of your decision with everyone who voted. Launch a WeeAct campaign around any decision using text and pictures. Here are some example decisions that WeeAct can help you make: - Fashion: What outfit should I wear? - Lifestyle: Which haircut should I get? - Consumer: What brand should I buy? - Blogging: Which tutorial should I post next on my blog? - Events: Which party should I go to tonight? - Design: What color should I paint my room? - Investing: Which stock should I buy? - Romance: Who should I go out on a date with? - Education: Which class should I enroll in? - Fitness: What should I do for my workout? - Health: What food should I eat on my diet? - Social: Which picture should I use in my profile? WeeAct Benefits: ● Create a decision campaign and harness the wisdom of the crowd in just seconds. ● Don't passively browse content. Participate in the decision-making of other users by voting on their choices and inspiring them to act. ● Stop scrolling through feeds of content that you don't care about. Automatically personalize your feed on WeeAct because every time you vote on a decision, you'll receive relevant content that shows the outcome. ● Stop wasting time looking at ads. WeeAct does not support or show ads anywhere on the app and all of our content is crowd-sourced by regular, everyday people, just like you! ● Think you give good advice? See for yourself using WeeAct's Voting Accuracy which tracks how often what you picked is the choice that gets made. ● Get feedback without the noise. Harassment is a major issue on some apps, but on WeeAct users cannot message each other and no one can post comments on campaigns. ● Create content your audience wants. Make your audience feel like they are part of the creative decision-making process by crowd-voting your content on WeeAct. ● Use our 5-star rating system to rate each other's decisions based on the success or failure of the outcome. ● Increase your vote totals by sharing your WeeAct campaigns on different social networks. ● WeeAct is committed to protecting all user data on our application. We do not sell or share any user data with third parties. The Human Intelligence App: WeeAct has been designed to take advantage of human intelligence by eliminating biases that exist within the crowd. Each voter is ambiguous to the decision-maker, which allows people to vote, honestly, based on their own experiences with that decision. The crowd becomes smarter as more votes are cast on any single decision by eliminating these biases. If life is just a series of decisions, WeeAct is too valuable of a utility not to use. If you struggle to make decisions, WeeAct will revolutionize your life. Download our app for free today and start making smarter decisions . . . together. Got feedback? Send us a message at info@weeact.com. Check out our social media on Twitter and Instagram @WeeActApp

 CertifID is a leader in wire fraud protection. We safeguard billions of dollars every month from fraud with advanced software, insurance, and proven recovery services. Trusted by title companies, law firms, lenders, realtors, and home buyers and sellers - CertifID provides further peace of mind with up to $1M in direct insurance coverage on every wire it protects. CertifID software uses the latest digital device verification, and multi-factor and knowledge-based authentication technologies, to analyze more than 150 markers of fraud in a matter of minutes. During the closing process, CertifID customers can store wiring instructions with a few clicks and securely share with home buyer and seller clients in seconds. For mortgage payoffs, CertifID replaces a historically long callback process with machine-learning software that validates more than 5,000+ mortgage servicers, including hard to validate lenders like Mr. Cooper. And we offer verification support from our team if the software can’t automatically validate the payoff. (Even these cases are usually resolved within less than 1-2 business days.) CertifID also provides recovery services to businesses and consumers hit with fraud, even if you aren’t yet using our software. We’ve partnered with federal law enforcement to recover $52M+ for fraud victims in the past two years, at a recovery rate 2x industry average.

This work, from commits and source code contains a wealth of information not only immediately valuable for ourselves but also to the larger engineering community to share, discuss, and most importantly learn from. After all, all software engineers ultimately do is write and commit code. Our commits and source code have it all: the languages and libraries we use, how much we show off by using fancy language features, what math we like, who we work with, how much we loath unit tests, and how brave we are to refactor. We want our work to speak for us and so created Sourcerer. Think of us as a hash of your code that digs deep, analyzes your technologies, habits, and preferences to show the world who you are as a software engineer. Sourcerer is headquartered in the San Francisco Bay Area with team members working remotely from all around the world.

      "text_2023: Espire Marketing was founded by Harrison Watson first as a digital marketing blog in 2007. In 2009, he took a leap of faith and launched a digital marketing agency focused specifically on serving small-to-medium-sized businesses. Why specialize in SMBs? Harrison's family is full of entrepreneurs who are in this category and he was tired of seeing how poorly other marketing agencies were serving them. In 2013, around the time that Amazon was making a major push into more categories, Harrison launched a Magento-based eCommerce marketing platform for SMBs that was designed to help smaller companies scale their product catalogs more effectively to be better prepared to compete with Amazon's product scalability. In 2015, Harrison leveraged his knowledge of this technology to join another specialist digital agency which he helped build from the ground up as the COO. What started as three people working out of a supply closet, grew into one of the most well-respected specialist agencies serving some of the largest retail brands on the planet. By 2018, after building the agency to a place where it could thrive without him, Harrison stepped away to get back to what he loved best, working with SMBs while also working on a project for the local food bank in urban farming. In 2019, Harrison began exploring a new agency model that would allow smaller companies the ability to get an ''agency of record'' service at a price that was affordable. In 2020, this effort was launched and is as you see it today.

Optimizing on-chip dataflow and connectivity is the cornerstone of our vision for system-on-chip development and assembly. Since our inception in 2003, we have pioneered the development and commercialization of NoC interconnect technology, cementing our position as the world‚Äôs first and largest commercial NoC interconnect IP company. Our unique technology meets the needs for cache coherent and non-coherent on-chip communications, on-chip data caching, and on-chip data protection to meet functional safety requirements. ARTERIS IP PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS Our on-chip NoC-based interconnect IP products make systems-on-chip easier to develop, perform better, and faster to get to market. The Arteris IP product portfolio meets the needs of design teams creating nearly any type of digital logic SoC with any type of communications semantics. Our seminal FlexNoC¬Æ Interconnect IP pioneered the market for NoC interconnects and is the industry leader. The highly configurable Ncore¬Æ Cache Coherent Interconnect IP allows optimal integration of cache-coherent Arm¬Æ-based processor IP with other cache-coherent and non-coherent IP. The growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) has inspired the creation of two innovative products. The Arteris IP AI Package is an option to Arteris FlexNoC that provides automated means to create complex topologies (meshes, rings, and tori) while adding multicast/broadcast communications, virtual channels, and source-synchronous communications to meet the unique needs of AI/ML chips. The CodaCache¬Æ Last Level Cache provides a highly configurable cache that can be instantiated anywhere within an SoC interconnect, providing data locality wherever needed. To meet the needs of the new generation of multibillion-transistor chips for automated systems with functional safety requirements, Arteris IP also offers Resilience Packages that provide hardware-based data protection technologies as well as automated diagnostic coverage analysis to help meet requirements ISO 26262 and IEC 61508 functional standards. Resilience Packages are available for FlexNoC, Ncore and CodaCache IP products. Timing closure has become a key design schedule constraint as chips have grown in size and complexity and semiconductor manufacturing process critical dimension have shrunk. To address this, Arteris IP created the PIANO¬Æ Timing Closure Package which provides physical and timing information about the interconnect to back-end synthesis place and route tools to help ensure faster timing closure.\n",

We‚Äôre not a tour. We‚Äôre not a news app. We‚Äôre the new form of timeless audio journalism. How many times have you passed buildings on your walk to the el without knowing anything about them or the people behind them? After we polled Chicago residents, we found that many still wanted to learn more about their city, specifically topics related to food, entertainment, landmarks and sports. And they wanted such information to be fairly short and easily-digestible. Our solution was to create original, bite-sized audio stories that are tied to specific locations. That way, users can learn while on the move and without deviating from their normal schedules. Our mission is to educate and make Chicago residents feel more connected to their surroundings, whether they're fresh to the city or lifelong residents and learners. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre not after typical tourist facts. We‚Äôre looking to tell the fun, quirky stories that even Chicago residents might not know. Our stories feature voices of people associated with each location, making it essentially come to life. The fun part? Users won't know when they'll receive our content notifications. They'll be spontaneous. So, let us be your city discovery soundtrack as you move throughout Chicago. You never know when Happenstance will find you.\n",

We talked with residents and found that they want to learn more about Chicago, whether they're fresh to the city or lifelong residents. And they want this information to be easily-digestible.

We create bite-sized, original audio pieces, essentially mini-podcasts, and tie them to different locations throughout the city. That way, listeners can hear something fun, quirky and new about their surroundings without taking extra time out of their day. We also offer businesses the opportunity to promote themselves through our fun, quirky stories. This allows them to advertise in a more authentic way to potential customers who are within close proximity. We strive to find and tell Chicago‚Äôs most interesting and little-known stories so we could make listeners feel smarter and more connected to this beautiful, rich city.

It relies on long term studies of career progression and the market forces impacting engagement and attrition. ‚Äã We don't stop at identifying those candidates with high likelihood to change jobs.

ENGAGE aggregates data from over 30K sources to create talent profiles on 100M professionals and 13M companies. ENGAGE's AI and machine learning engine predicts the likelihood that a candidate will respond to a conversation about a potential job change, and recommends personalized messaging based on factors like their career progression, skills, peer actions, and the news and events surrounding their company.

The result is a more efficient and productive talent acquisition team who fills roles proactively by engaging qualified talent instead of waiting for the right applicant to come to them.

This artificial intelligence enables Cargonexx to provide a new service: Oneclick - Trucking. A freight forwarder enters a truck load into cargonexx, instantly gets a price and confirms with one click. Cargonexx takes over the load as a fully responsible freight forwarder. Carriers enter their free capacity using an intelligent software agent. Cargonexx automatically matches loads to free capacities. The carrier gets the offer he looks for without searching and can confirm with one click. The service is free of charge.\n",

Cargonexx was awarded as the best mobility start-up in Europe and won numerous prizes, including the German Digital Prize by McKinsey.\n",

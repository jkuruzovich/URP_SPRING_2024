"We would like your assistance with labeling the pivot of two business descriptions, one in 2018 and one in 2023. Delimited by '---' below, we have first included a dictionary which shows two different levels, indicating the business description between years pivot or not. We then include a second dictionary that has example business descriptions that pivoted and not pivoted for each of the associated levels.
Next, assign an overall confidence score for the pivot assessment, ranging from 1 to 7, and assign a confidence score for the pivot assessment, ranging from 1 to 7.

We would like you to then provide an assessment of the overall pivot of the third description provided and you should return a JSON object with values for an 'overall assessment' (1-7), as well as different aspects of the pivot types ('zoom-in pivot', 'zoom-out pivot', 'customer segment pivot', 'customer need pivot', 'platform pivot', 'business architecture pivot', 'value capture pivot', 'engine of growth pivot', 'channel pivot', 'technology pivot'). For each of the areas provide a 1/0 rating, a list of what is known from the description and what can be easily inferred as separate items in the JSON.  If  'zoom-in pivot' single feature in the product becomes the whole product, 'zoom-out pivot' whole product and making it instead of a single feature of a much larger product, 'customer segment pivot' that targeting the correct customer that you built the product for them, 'customer need pivot' the problem they are trying to solve is not important to the customer so try to change it or come up with a different product that the customer need, 'platform pivot' that change from application to platform or vice versa, 'business architecture pivot' that startups change their business architecture such as from high volume, low margin to high margin, low volume, 'value capture pivot' that change the way of capturing the value, 'engine of growth pivot' that change its growth strategy to be more profitable growth, 'channel pivot' that find a creative and effective way to reach its customer, 'technology pivot' everything is the same, but find new technology instead of existing one that can provide cost-less and better performance such as cloud computing. If 'zoom-in pivot', 'zoom-out pivot', 'customer segment pivot', 'customer need pivot', 'platform pivot', 'business architecture pivot', 'value capture pivot', 'engine of growth pivot', 'channel pivot', and 'technology pivot' are not clear or easily inferred from the description, just enter NULL and return the results as a JSON object.

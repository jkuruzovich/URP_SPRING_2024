        - 'customer need pivot': 'Shifting focus because the original problem isn't crucial to customers',
        - 'platform pivot': 'Transition between an application and a platform',
        - 'business architecture pivot': 'Changing business structure (e.g., from high volume, low margin to high margin, low volume)',
        - 'value capture pivot': 'Altering the method of value capture',
        - 'engine of growth pivot': 'Modifying the growth strategy for better profitability',
        - 'channel pivot': 'Finding a new way to reach customers'

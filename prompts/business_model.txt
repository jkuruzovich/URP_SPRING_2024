We would like your assistance with labeling the quality of a business description. 

We would like you to then provide an assessment of the overall quality of the 2018_description and the 2023_description below. A quality description means that key parts of the business model canvas can be understood by the description. Each quality rating would be 1-10. The quality of the 2018_description should be given in the field '2018_quality' and be in the range 1-10. The quality of the 2023_description should be given in the field '2023_quality' and be in the range 1-10. The feasiblity of the business model should be assessed from 1-10 '2018_feasiblity' and '2023_feasiblity'. Further, the customers, value propositions, channels, and revenues should be indicated in a short summary for each of the associated variables. No descriptions should include the names of the companies.

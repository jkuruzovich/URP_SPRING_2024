Evaluate the business descriptions:
text_2018: {text_2018}

text_2023: {text_2023}


We request your assessment of business descriptions provided in the Excel file columns 'text_2018' and 'text_2023,' representing company profiles from 2018 and 2023, respectively.
Part 1: Pivot Assessment
Context: In this evaluation, a 'pivot' is defined as a substantial change in the business model resulting from alterations in the customer, product, strategy, or engine of growth (Reiss 2011).
Instructions: For each row in the dataset, carefully review the text descriptions of the companies in 2018 and 2023. Using the provided definition, assess whether a pivot has occurred. Assign a '1' in the pivot column if a pivot has taken place; otherwise, enter '0.' Additionally, indicate the probability (0-100) of a pivot occurrence. In the justification column, provide a clear explanation of the factors influencing your decision regarding the pivot assessment.
Part 2: Pivot Type Assessments
Context: Common pivot types represent systematic changes in business models. Consider the following types of pivots:
1.	'Zoom-in pivot': A single feature becomes the whole product.
2.	'Zoom-out pivot': The whole product becomes a single feature of a larger product.
3.	'Customer segment pivot': Targeting the correct customer for whom the product was built.
4.	'Customer need pivot': The problem being solved is not important to the customer; consider changing it.
5.	'Platform pivot': Changing from application to a platform or vice versa.
6.	'Business architecture pivot': Changing the business architecture (e.g., from high volume, low margin to high margin, low volume).
7.	'Value capture pivot': Changing the way value is captured.
8.	'Engine of growth pivot': Changing the growth strategy for more profitable growth.
9.	'Channel pivot': Finding a creative and effective way to reach customers.
10.	'Technology pivot': Keeping everything the same but adopting new technology (e.g., cloud computing).
Instructions: For each row in the dataset, if you believe a pivot has occurred (i.e., you have entered a '1' in the pivot column for Part 1), use the provided definitions of pivot types to indicate the pivot types (can be more than one) in the associated labeled columns. Assign a '1' if that pivot type has occurred; otherwise, enter '0.' If you indicated that a pivot occurred you must enter at least 1 pivot type
